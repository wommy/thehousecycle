		<summary>WHAT DOES YOUR LOGO MEAN?</summary>
		<p>Alot of deep design and thinking went into developing the most perfected logo on the planet.  Since our company is a derivative of upcycling, but solely based on the housing/real estate market we coined the name Housecycle.  We incorporated a negative space arrow in our logo that points upward and colors that were fun and playful.  We wanted to remove the stigmatism surrounded by this industry IE typical “cash for house” sites that currently flood our market for a warm inviting and transparent approach.  Since we are primarily a property reinvigorator and solution provider we extend way beyond just an offer solely of cash.</p>

Since we live in MI we are MI and will personally walk through your house with you and assess damage and rehab costs.  We are not from out of state wholesaling your deal to others out of state buyers and sellers to make a quick buck.  Our ultimate goal is to provide you the seller the easiest, best solution to your problem.  Then housecycling your property to help the local market value and future family buyers to get the right start in MI living.</p>
