	<h3>Elliott Marshall</h3>
	<p>Originally from Maui, Hawaii, but raised in the great state of MI.  The very first question people often ask me when they meet me and find out about my birthplace is “why did you move here”?  My replay to this question will have to be in person once you meet me.  I am a huge family man, religion plays a large part of my life and morals and I believe my journey keeps leading me to help people.  Life tends to get very complex as we get older and stress tends to play a major part of inhibiting living a quality life.  My mission among many is to help you through these moments and customize a personalized solution that fits your needs.</p>
