				<h2>The 3 Housecycle Steps</h2>
				<p>In complete detail and clarity</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Step 1 THE FORM</h3>
						<p>Fill out our simple form using your cellphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop.  With this information we have a basis of where to start our formulation for the cash offer we will present to you. We also begin the process of putting together our estimated ARV (After Repair Value), pulling comparable and doing market research for that location.  Rest assured the information that you provide us is secure and safe.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Step 2 THE CALL</h3>
						<p>You will receive a call to discuss the information that you provided us.  At this point, we will setup a time and day to visit to your house for a general walk through to gather information for the ARV (After Repair Value).  Using this information we’re able to refine the estimated projection of cost on “housecycling” your property.  </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Step 3 THE CASH</h3>
						<p>Within 24 hours, you will be presented with a fair cash offer, as well as details on how we arrived at that number.  Remember, there is no obligation to take the offer, but should you choose to do so, we can discuss the next steps to take such as closing, relocating, etc.  We at Housecycle are very flexible, accommodating, and understanding when it comes to the stress of moving, so we are here to help make the process easier on you.</p>
						<p>***No exchange of money will be present at this time until the closing of the property.***</p>
					</li>
