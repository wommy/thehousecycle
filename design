	the 3 housecycle steps
	in complete detail and clarity
	3 columns
		step[1,2,3]
		[the form, the call, the cash]
			Fill out our simple form using your cellphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop.  With this information we have a basis of where to start our formulation for the cash offer we will present to you. We also begin the process of putting together our estimated ARV (After Repair Value), pulling comparable and doing market research for that location.  Rest assured the information that you provide us is secure and safe.
			You will receive a call to discuss the information that you provided us.  At this point, we will setup a time and day to visit to your house for a general walk through to gather information for the ARV (After Repair Value).  Using this information we’re able to refine the estimated projection of cost on “housecycling” your property.  
			Within 24 hours, you will be presented with a fair cash offer, as well as details on how we arrived at that number.  Remember, there is no obligation to take the offer, but should you choose to do so, we can discuss the next steps to take such as closing, relocating, etc.  We at Housecycle are very flexible, accommodating, and understanding when it comes to the stress of moving, so we are here to help make the process easier on you.  		***No exchange of money will be present at this time until the closing of the property.***

=== about
article
	meet the creator
	the brainchild of what is now housecycle
	pic
	elliott marshall
	Originally from Maui, Hawaii, but raised in the great state of MI.  The very first question people often ask me when they meet me and find out about my birthplace is “why did you move here”?  My replay to this question will have to be in person once you meet me.  I am a huge family man, religion plays a large part of my life and morals and I believe my journey keeps leading me to help people.  Life tends to get very complex as we get older and stress tends to play a major part of inhibiting living a quality life.  My mission among many is to help you through these moments and customize a personalized solution that fits your needs.
